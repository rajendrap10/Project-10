Hi

This is a FSJS Live Class Project No. 10 Repo. I have learn to develop responsive web page from srache. I haver converted design to html & used to core css and media query for making it responsive. 

I have used flex properties for cards section and for responsive pages.

I would like to say Thankyou my instructor `Hitesh Choudhary` for the guiding, mentoring and pushing me hard so that I can learn and develop this project.
